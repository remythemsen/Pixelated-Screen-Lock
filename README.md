# Pixelated-Screen-Lock

This script requires scrot, i3(with i3lock) and imagemagick with convert. When the script is called a screenshot of the current screen(s) is taken, and pixelated, then i3lock locks the screen using 
the newly generated pictures as a background. 

The wanted effect is that the screen looks 'pixelated' when locked
